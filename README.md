# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A content-based and collaborative filtering movie recommendation system built using Python and machine learning techniques. This project aims to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and ratings.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Content-based filtering (using genres, tags, and movie descriptions)
- âœ… Collaborative filtering (using user ratings)
- âœ… Cosine similarity for movie matching
- âœ… Interactive interface with Jupyter Notebook
- âœ… Real-world movie datasets (`movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`)

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Cosine Similarity
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Matrix Factorization (optional, depending on your implementation)
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data processing and ML

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Used the **MovieLens dataset**, including:
- `movies.csv`: Contains movie titles and genres
- `ratings.csv`: User ratings for movies

> Dataset source: [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
